# personaGen

## Description
personaGen is an easy-to-use and customizable generator of fake user identities. Each time you ask personaGen to “generate a new persona”, it responds with the profile photo, name, age, and other personal information about a person that does not exist.

Our primary user is a developer who is working on a product that will either serve, or otherwise deal with, the data from a number of users. During their development process, our user will use personaGen to generate new and unique identities, which they can use for testing their own project.

A personaGen user can choose to generate random personae, or control custom parameters such as the age range, nationality, or profession of the persona to suit their unique project needs.
